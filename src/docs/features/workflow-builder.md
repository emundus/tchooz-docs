# Workflow Builder

[[toc]]

## Overview
This module allows managers to create and manage workflows for their applicants. A workflow is a series of steps that an applicant must complete in order to apply for a position. Managers can define the steps, assign them to different users, and track the progress of each applicant through the workflow.
